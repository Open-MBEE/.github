## Welcome to OpenMBEE
OpenMBEE (Open Model Based Engineering Environment) is an open source collaborative engineering system. It enables engineers to work in the language of their choice and easily share and document their work across other tools.

## OpenMBEE Architectures
### Execubot
The Execubot architecture allows Systems Engineers to develop models in their enterprise model development platform and publish aspects of the model to the web.  

Popular Repositories:
- [Model Management System](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/mms) - Management and version control for SysML models
- [Cameo Model Development Kit](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/mdk) - Cameo Systems Modeler plugin for defining views for View Editor
- [View Editor](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/ve) - Interact with SysML models within a web-based environment

### Flexo
Flexo expands on the concept of version control models from execubot. Execubots representation of the data is in JSON, Flexo exposes models as RDF. Models in Flexo are not limited to enterprise model development platforms. A model in Flexo can be anything that is represented as RDF.

Popular Repositories:  
- [mms5-layer1-service](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/mms5-layer1-service) - REST server allowing for CRUD operations of named graphs
- [openapi-graph-extractor](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/openapi-graph-extractor) - Converts well-defined JSON data to RDF by consuming an OpenAPI document 
- [mms5-deployment](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/mms5-deployment) - YAML files for deployment of MMS5 services in k8s
